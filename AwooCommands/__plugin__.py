# Place all custom commands and command packages in this file, like so:
# import CommandLinks
#
# Be sure to use one per line, and do NOT import anything with underscores (_) in the name, unless you know exactly what you're doing.
# Also, do not add BaseCommands, CommandLinks, or ModeratorCommands to this file. They are already imported.
#
# Any commands imported from this file will take precedence over any commands from the builtins.
